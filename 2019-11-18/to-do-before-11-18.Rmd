## Pre-Meeting Assignment

1. Install / Update R. Choose your operating system [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).
2. (Optional, but very helpful) Install / Update RStudio. Choose your operating system [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

If you cannot complete these steps prior to the meeting, please [arrive](https://library.arlingtonva.us/locations/central-library/) by 5:45pm. 

Mac users, if you are choosing to install R & RStudio with Homebrew, you are on your own. I (Sam) have tried to do this many times, but it has never been a better solution for me than downloading & using the installers from the web. 

Linux users, if you have troubles, I am sorry, but I (Sam) cannot help you. But, given that you are already Linux users, you can probably help yourselves. `r emo::ji("stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye")`
